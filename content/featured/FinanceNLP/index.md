Developed a Natural Language Processor that uses sentiment analysis to predict stock trends based on celebrity tweets. Tried and tested multiple models (including Logistic Regression Bag of Words, Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network, and Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Tranformers), to maximize performance and precision. The LLM was trained with real datasets and finally achieved a remarkable consistent 97% acurracy with its predictions. This project was built under the guidance of a Stanford Alumni, and was presented at an Inspirit AI Symposium.
