Developed Contactopus: an Android application designed to streamline networking and socializing in public gatherings. The app implements libraries generates personalized QR Codes for efficient sharing of multiple contact cards (with customizable fields based on formality and relevancy of interactions). The app uses a scanner to automate the process of mass-saving these contact cards into the local memory of the recepient's phone. I conducted user surveys and gathered feedback for improvements, before finally documenting my development journey on Bootcamp, a tech blog on Medium.
