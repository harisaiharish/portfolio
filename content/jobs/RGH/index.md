- As part of a community outreach initiative, I was the lead teacher for Computer Science at Ramagondanahalli Government School: a school for underprivileged children from monetarily challenged backgrounds.
- Over 2 years, I introduced 2 batches of 40 8th-grade schoolchildren to coding, using Scratch as a medium for learning.
- Taught 3 hours every week, and prepared worksheets, homework, and revision modules before every session.
- Guided students to win 15,000 INR for placing 2/254 teams in Code to Enhance Learning (CEL): a National Hackathon.
