- Architecting a fault-tolerant, tick-based pipeline to replicate and sync customer data (including intermediate artifacts) to all active NAS nodes via GCP, ensuring seamless failover across HPC rigs.
- Hosting a virtualized TrueNAS environment on GCP (using QEMU on KVM), to support remote setup and rigorous testing.
- Developed a comprehensive observability infrastructure for High-Performance Computing rigs, to monitor real-time system health/performance across 50+ distributed nodes. Reduced incident detection time by over 40%.
- Created an automated secure workflow for dynamic environment creation, allowing users to clone GitHub repos, by auditing Dockerfiles, building container images, and uploading artifacts to Google Cloud for future HPC tasks.
