- Conceptualized and spearheaded the development of “Shortest Root”, a pioneering website revolutionizing meet-up planning in unfamiliar or traffic-heavy cities.
- Utilized React.js, Google Maps APIs, and SQLite technologies, to develop this platform that triangulates and displays potential meet-up spots that fulfill every user’s preferential and locational parametric requirements, while suggesting sustainable public transit route options.
- Developed this project for Oakridge Codefest: India’s largest overnight hackathon for secondary schools, and led my team (of 4 classmates) to win first place: securing a trophy and a 30,000 INR cash prize.
- We are now re-creating this project with the intention of professional deployment. -->
